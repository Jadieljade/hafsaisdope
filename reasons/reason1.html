           <p>Hi so I am writing all this nikiwa sort of nervous.
             Not because sijui what to say necessarily ni juu sijui how you’ll take all this.  
             😂😂😂😂😂🤣Najiambia I’m familiar to bad decisions so this cannot be one. 
             It is always great kuanza na a joke so I’ll do a three step joke the other two zitakuwa tu somewhere. 
            Tell me if you get all of them. So why are elephants so good at hiding behind trees? Because you never see them 🥁🥁. <br> <br>
             Lets begin, kunakuwanga na two categories of people in my life. 1. Those I don’t give a shit about and basically do not even acknowledge their existence and those I love and can’t think of any scenario in my life where they were not part of it na unahappen kuwa in the second category. 
             😅 Kuna someone who asked me once why I am friends with you. Nilicheka the question juu nilijua nikijibu ingesound like the lie guys spew but nitakushow juu it’s a seriously selfish reason. This really feels like an undressing😅😅. Ni weird that niko embarrassed writing about this. Anyway, the answer ni PEACE. 
              <br> <br>If I’m just hanging out with you nakuwanga so comfortable juu nakuwanga at peace not just
               in the moment but at peace with who I am. We can talk about the weirdest shit I can tell you my
                darkest secrets and I’ll still be at peace knowing that ni wewe naaambia.
                I enjoy that shit bana juu most of the time it’s like I am a different person. 
                I don’t do people but if ni wewe any day any time any chance ya kucheka stupid 
                jokes and talk about stuff you can’t talk with someone else. That is my shot ya dopamine man. <br> <br>
                 You see I am friends with you because I love who I am when I am with you uncensored relaxed and 
                 at peace and that is something I value so much. 😂unaona inasound so cheesy but that is the reality.
                  Shida ni tu that you’re so beautiful and with a killer body so I believe no one else would believe that
                   is the reason apart from wewe. <br> <br>Of course, mimi huacknowledge that you’re pretty and really hot na si once
                    or twice mind imeslip up nikapicture my face buried between those cheeks not even wanting to come out for
                     air or watched you smile and wondered what those lips taste like or even wondered how your boobs would
                      feel squashed up on my naked chest or held your hands and wondered how they’d feel on my body. <br> But I
                       suppress all that with the hope that you never notice any desire because I enjoy spending time with
                        you so much. It sucks explaining to anyone else who only sees that but can’t understand that beneath
                         all that is a beautiful heart and an amazing soul with one twisted exciting mind. <br> <br>
                          Only you can understand this.
                           You’re as messed up as I am but still there’s nothing I can do with anyone that I couldn’t
                            with you but not everything I can with you I could with anyone else and that why were friends. 
                            We are equally as messed up but equally lovers of life. </p>
