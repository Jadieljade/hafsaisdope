           <p>What I love about poetry by the way is how the simplest things can be expressed in the most beautiful ways.
             What I hate ni how you can never really write out of a whim especially with me lazima kuwe na a sort of 
             stimulation (no pun intended) and when writing that all I could think about is how amazing you are. I think you don’t even know that yourself. 
             <br> <br>By the way at times I only want to see you so I can know If you’re truly happy. I’ve learnt something
              about you btw and that is you’re very good at faking happiness😅.
               Now I might be very wrong on this but at times I’ve seen videos of you outside “having fun”
                and wanted to know what was happening in your life because at times it would 
                look as more of an escape from reality attempt than actual fun and it bugs me 
                to know that I can’t really do anything to anything to help in those moments. it’s funny that I 
                can’t say I’m happy myself but I really hate knowing you’re unhappy and knowing currently all 
                I can do is try to get you to smile or laugh. <br> <br>For even if for a second, I can help you forget your worries it pleases me because you deserve all the best the world has to offer and that is something I know I’d want to give you but right now couldn’t. 
            With everything you’re going through I need to at least be one person you can count on to unload your
             problems and to remind you that you are amazing I every single way. 
             <br><br>So, this is the point where I say I am really sorry for not being there for you. 
             I am sorry I can’t hug you and kiss your forehead and make all your troubles disappear.
              I am sorry for not being a place of solace or a blanket in the coldest days (no pun intended once more).
               I am sorry that I can’t be a super hero to swoop in and save the day every time. <br><br>
               I do promise though to always be there to always laugh and share weird jokes to always hug you even
                when you don’t want me to always offer a chest for your tears and an ear for your
                 rants when you need me to. <br> <br>
            Why because you bring me peace and joy and id like to offer the same.
            Question. what is the loudest noise in the jungle? When monkeys go cherry picking🥁🥁
