            I rarely write poems nowadays but I wouldn't dare have this an not write one for you beautiful. Btw. Why do elephants paint their balls red? So they can hide behind cherry treesü•Åü•Å
<br> <br>

In the gleamiest day with no hope and no light, <br>
Love and endless kindness, she brings to sight,<br>
Offering unequivocal peace, both warm and bright,<br>
Voices loud laughter abound, hearts taking flight.<br>
Every moment every second in her grace,<br>
You‚Äôll find a smile upon your face.<br>
Our hearts synchronized in this void of time and space, <br>
Unblemished love the guiding bliss.<br><br>

Evening stars got nothing on her light,<br>
Vast and serene, calming the night,<br>
Endless tranquility, friendship true and pure,<br>
Now and always, with each other we feel secure.<br><br>

More than words, her actions show,<br>
Our moments, immortalized in her glow,<br>
Radiant beauty, elegance inside and out,<br>
Enchanting charm, without a doubt.<br><br>

Now everything feels better in every way,<br>
Our lives are brighter every day,<br>
Within her presence anyone would to stay.<br>

Her spirit, strong and kind,<br>
A precious gem, a rare find,<br>
Faithful, steadfast, ever so true,<br>
She brings joy in all she‚Äôll do.<br>
Always amazing even when it all doesn‚Äôt align<br>
