        Hello. So hii ni one of those things that you do knowing it might turn
        into a cringe moment So before ata you open this, This is meant as an
        apology for not being there when you needed. <br />
        First ata niko honoured being the one you'd want to talk to when life is
        not being kind. Here is the deal. This is meant to in the very least get
        a smile out of you. I remember you saying you hate apologies so this
        will not be phrased as one. <br />
        However the deal hapa should you choose to accept is that if you smile
        even once through this then you forgive my negligence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Do we have a deal?</p>
